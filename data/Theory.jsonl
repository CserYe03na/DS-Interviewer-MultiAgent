For example, a model for predicting revenue of a company have of two features - the number of items a sold and the number of items b sold. When company sells more items a the revenue increases and this is independent of the number of items b sold. But, if customers who buy a stop buying b , the additivity assumption is violated. 3. Features are not correlated (no collinearity ) since it can be difficult to separate out the individual effects of collinear features on the target variable. 4.

No correlation between errors (consecutive errors in the case of time series data). 2. Constant variance of errors - homoscedasticity . For example, in case of time series, seasonal patterns can increase errors in seasons with higher activity. 3.

After these values are selected, grid search then evaluates the algorithm using each and every combination of hyper-parameters and returns the combination that gives the optimal result (i.e. lowest MAE). Because grid search evaluates the given algorithm using all combinations, it's easy to see that this can be quite computationally expensive and can lead to sub-optimal results specifically since the user needs to specify specific values for these hyper-parameters, which is prone for error and requires domain knowledge. <b Random Search</b is similar to grid search but differs in the sense that rather than specifying which values to try for each hyper-parameter, an upper and lower bound of values for each hyper-parameter is given instead. With uniform probability, random values within these bounds are then chosen and similarly, the best combination is returned to the user. Although this seems less intuitive, no domain knowledge is necessary and theoretically much more of the parameter space can be explored. In a completely different framework, <b Bayesian Optimization</b is thought of as a more statistical way of optimization and is commonly used when using neural networks, specifically since one evaluation of a neural network can be computationally costly. In numerous research papers, this method heavily outperforms Grid Search and Random Search and is currently used on the Google Cloud Platform as well as AWS. Because an in-depth explanation requires a heavy background in bayesian statistics and gaussian processes (and maybe even some game theory), a \"simple\" explanation is that a much simpler/faster <i acquisition function</i intelligently chooses (using a <i surrogate function</i such as probability of improvement or GP-UCB) which hyper-parameter values to try on the computationally expensive, original algorithm.

The most common/popular technique is SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling technique) Suppression: Though not recommended, we can drop off some features directly responsible for the imbalance. Learning Fair Representation: Projecting the training examples to a subspace or plane minimizes the data imbalance. Re-Weighting: We can assign some weights to each training example to reduce the imbalance in the data.", "metadata": {"title": "What is Pre-Processing?", "domain": "theory", "subdomain": "fairness_and_imbalance", "taxonomy_skill": ["fairness_and_imbalance"], "raw_topics": [], "source": "Machine Learning Interview Questions & Answers for Data Scientists.md"}}
{"id": "theory_00173", "vector_content": "Regularisation: We can add score terms that measure the data imbalance in the loss function and therefore minimizing the loss function will also minimize the degree of imbalance concerning the score chosen which also indirectly minimizes other metrics that measure the degree of data imbalance. Adversarial Debiasing: Here we use the adversarial notion to train the model where the discriminator tries to detect if there are signs of data imbalance in the predicted data by the generator and hence the generator learns to generate data that is less prone to imbalance.", "metadata": {"title": "What is In-Processing?", "domain": "theory", "subdomain": "fairness_and_imbalance", "taxonomy_skill": ["fairness_and_imbalance"], "raw_topics": [], "source": "Machine Learning Interview Questions & Answers for Data Scientists.md"}}
